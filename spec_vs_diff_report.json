  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the requested requirements. All major pages, components, services, and state management are present. However, the Three.js/React Three Fiber animated background for the Landing Page was replaced with an SVG/CSS-only animation, and Framer Motion transitions are absent throughout. Required image assets are not included. The api.ts file is omitted from the diff due to truncation limits.",
